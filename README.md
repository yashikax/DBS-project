### Online Trade & Auction System
An online trade and auction database system is a digital platform designed to facilitate the buying 
and selling of goods over the Internet. This system provides a secure and user-friendly interface 
for buyers and sellers to engage in transactions, allowing users to create accounts, register as a 
buyer or sellers, and list items for sale or bid on the items they are interested in purchasing.
